# atennop dotfiles
This repository contains complete (almost) snapshot of my config files and overall setup that I made when I was ricing my Linux laptop, which btw took almost a month.
<br>Setup is heavily inspired by both [**Tsoding**](https://www.youtube.com/tsoding) and [**ThePrimeagen**](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen), two legends of modern IT. I got distro, WM and philosphy from Tsoding, and text editor, terminal multiplexer and flex from ThePrimeagen.

It's also important to note that there are bunch of other little things that I'm too lazy to talk about, but you can just lurk inside these dotfiles and find them out yourself :)
<br>I can only say that this setup is perfect for my personal usage and contains a lot of REALLY minor stuff on which I worked pretty hard.
